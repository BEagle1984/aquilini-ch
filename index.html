        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Sergio Aquilini, a passionate and forward-thinking Solution Architect and Senior .NET Developer with
            over 20 years of professional experience.
            I specialize in modern software architecture, microservices, asynchronous messaging, and high-quality
            software delivery.
            I have a strong track record of leading complex projects from concept to production, delivering robust and
            scalable enterprise systems.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Role</h2>
        <p>
            At <em>Swiss Post</em>, I serve as a <em>Solution Architect</em>
            within the Logistics Services
            cluster, with a particular focus on the domain of sorting. Among other responsibilities, I actively
            contribute to the <em>Sorting Solutions</em> team, where we are shaping the next
            generation of sorting systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our solutions are built on a modern, <em>cloud-native</em> stack based on
            <em>.NET</em>, <em>Kafka</em>, and <em>MQTT</em>,
            deployed on <em>AWS EKS</em>. We rely on <em>PostgreSQL</em> and
            <em>MongoDB</em> for data storage, and use <em>Splunk</em> and
            <em>Grafana</em> extensively to ensure deep <em>observability</em>
            into our systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            We embrace <em>DevOps</em> principles and take full ownership of the services we build,
            from design through deployment to production operation. Our development process is trunk-based, with
            <em>continuous delivery</em> and fully <em>automated testing</em>. We
            maintain 100% test coverage and avoid any manual testing entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
            A key part of our engineering culture is a zero-error/warning policy in production. We continuously refine
            our codebase and application logs to ensure that the systems remain clean, observable, and reliable. This
            commitment to quality and transparency is fundamental to our ability to move fast and
            <em>deliver with confidence</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>Past Projects</h2>
        <p>
            Among the major projects I’ve contributed to, I led the complete architectural overhaul of the former E-Post
            Office platform, now rebranded as <em>ePost</em>, which was rebuilt entirely from scratch. The legacy monolith was
            replaced with a modern, cloud-native solution built on microservices, using .NET Core and NativeScript for
            the mobile apps. Designed for tight integration with a variety of internal and external systems, the
            solution emphasized cutting-edge architecture, automation, comprehensive testing, and high-quality
            continuous delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before that, I spent several years developing and operating <em>postshop.ch</em>, Swiss Post’s primary
            e-commerce platform. The system was built on Microsoft Commerce Server and evolved into a fully customized
            solution, including automated integration with multiple vendors and internal services. It was a large-scale,
            business-critical application that I helped shape end to end, from core architecture to operational
            stability.
        </p>

        <h2>Open Source</h2>
        <p>
            I’m the author and maintainer of
            <a href="https://www.silverback-messaging.net" target="_blank">Silverback</a>, a powerful, elegant, and
            feature-rich message bus for .NET, designed to simplify <em>asynchronous messaging</em>,
            <em>event-driven architectures</em>, and microservice communication.
            With seamless integration for <em>Apache Kafka</em> and <em>MQTT</em>,
            it offers robust capabilities for reliability, consistency, and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.silverback-messaging.net" target="_blank">Silverback</a> started as a personal side
            project, driven by the need for a better messaging abstraction during the early stages of the ePost
            platform. Over time, it evolved into a mature and production-grade framework that is now the standard
            messaging solution for all .NET applications at Swiss Post.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maintaining <a href="https://www.silverback-messaging.net" target="_blank">Silverback</a> continues to be a
            source of inspiration and technical growth. Its inherently asynchronous and distributed nature introduces
            unique engineering challenges, such as race conditions, delivery guarantees, concurrency handling, and
            integration complexity. Tackling these problems pushes me to continuously refine the architecture and
            deliver solutions that are both performant and developer-friendly.
